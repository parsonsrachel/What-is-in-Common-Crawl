# What-is-in-Common-Crawl
Machine learning project to investigate what types of data exist in Common Crawl

# September 12
Figured out next steps and what to complete for next class. Started looking at the requirements for the project proposal. Assigned tasks to complete before next class. Add to proposal document with thoughts from literature review. Try querying common crawl to figure out how to use it.
