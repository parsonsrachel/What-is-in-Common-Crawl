Machine learning project to investigate what types of data exist in Common Crawl

Figured out next steps and what to complete for next class. Started looking at the requirements for the project proposal. Assigned tasks to complete before next class. Add to proposal document with thoughts from literature review. Try querying common crawl to figure out how to use it.

Tried pulling data from Common Crawl, but were not yet successful. Added to the literature review. Allocated proposal paper sections with the intention to be done with a first draft of the proposal by next class. 

# September 19
Started the proposal presentation and assigned slides. Still need to edit the paper and fix formating. Still have not figured out how to query Common Crawl.
